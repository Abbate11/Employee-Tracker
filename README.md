## Description

Built this employee tracker to practice manipulating DOM elements with javascript and change displayed elements based on user input.

In this project you will see various uses of functions, objects, while loops, for loops, promt functions, and much more.

You will also see Math.() functions to determine random indexes from an array. 

This tracker allows you to enter Employee names and their coresponding salaries and displays this information in a table.

It will also calculate the average salaries of the employees and select a random employee to be deemed the "Winner".

I learned a lot about formatting data into arrays and manipulating that data. I also learned how to run loops based on user input, and stop these loops when necessary.
